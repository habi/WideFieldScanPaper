# Radiation dose optimized lateral expansion of the field of view in synchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy

During my PhD at the [Institute of Anatomy](http://ana.unibe.ch) of the [University of Bern](http://unibe.ch) I was running a SVN repository server on the [virtual server infrastructure](http://www.id.unibe.ch/content/services/hosting/virtuelle_server/) of the University of Bern.

Since I'm no longer working there I migrated all the code to GitHub, using `git svn clone http://code.ana.unibe.ch/svn/RepositoryName`

This repository contains everything that was necessary to write the paper about *[Radiation dose optimized lateral expansion of the field of view in synchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy](https://doi.org/10.1107/S0909049510019618)* in the [Journal of Synchrotron Radiation](http://journals.iucr.org/s/) and landed us a cover image in it.
